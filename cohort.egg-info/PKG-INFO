Description: # CohortTable
        ##  Projecting per-Person Revenue Using Productivity Ramp Up Periods
        
        ### Quick Instructions
        1. Download Cohort.py to local working directory
        2. Create new instance by calling CohortTable() class using the arguments listed below.
        
        One of the most common modeling tasks is to create future revenue projections based on a hiring plan, where hires are not immediately productive and only reach their full potential after a period of time.
        Import and call the CohortTable class to automatically generate Full Time Equivalent (FTE), employee count, and revenue tables based on 6 variables.
        The class and associated output tables will:
        * Allow for setting the forecast period to any length
        * Provide a ‘productivity ramp-up period’ to account for lower productivity in the early years of new hires
        * Account for attrition (each cohort will be reduced over time as people leave the company)
        * Provide for mid-point hiring (i.e., assume that hires happen throughout the year, not on the first of the fiscal year)
        * Allow for full-year hiring for the first period (since the first cohort class may be identified in advance, e.g., be included in the acquisition)
        
        Call the CohortTable class using the following arguments.
        * forecast_period (required) Int -- The length of the forecast period
        * n_years (required) Int -- The length over which to 'ramp up' productivity from 0 to 100%
        * hires_per_year (required) List of Integers -- How many employees will be hired each year, will be reshaped to fit forecast_period if necessary
        * revenue_goal (required) Int -- The revenue per person when productivity is 100%
        * annual_attrition (optional) Decimal -- Average percentage of attrition, expressed as decimal between 0 and 1. Default = .15.
        * first_year_full_hire (optional) True / False -- Whether to use mid-point hiring for first year calculation. Default = False
